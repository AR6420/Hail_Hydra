## 🧬 What is Hydra?

You know how in the movies, Hydra had agents embedded *everywhere*, silently getting things done in the background? That's exactly what this framework does for your Claude Code sessions.

**Hydra** is a task-level speculative execution framework inspired by [Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318) in LLM inference. Instead of making one expensive model (Opus 4.6) do *everything* — from searching files to writing entire modules — Hydra deploys a team of specialized **"heads"** running on faster, cheaper models that handle the grunt work.

The result? **Opus becomes a manager, not a laborer.** It classifies tasks, dispatches them to the right head, glances at the output, and moves on. The user never notices. It's invisible. It's always on.

> **Four built-in speed optimizations** reduce overhead at every stage: speculative pre-dispatch
> (scout launches in parallel with task classification), session indexing (codebase context
> persists across turns — no re-exploration), fire-and-forget dispatch (non-critical agents run
> in the background without blocking downstream work), and confidence-based auto-accept (raw
> factual outputs skip Opus review entirely).

> **Think of it this way:**
>
> Would you hire a $500/hr architect to carry bricks? No. You'd have them design the building and let the crew handle construction. That's Hydra.

## 🖥️ Status Line

After installation, your Claude Code status bar shows real-time framework info:

```
🐉 │ Opus │ Ctx: 37% ████░░░░░░ │ $0.42 │ my-project
```

| Element | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| 🐉 | Hydra is active |
| Model | Current Claude model (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) |
| Ctx: XX% | Context window usage with visual bar |
| $X.XX | Session API cost so far |
| Directory | Current working directory |

**Context bar colors:**
- 🟢 Green (0–49%) — plenty of room
- 🟡 Yellow (50–79%) — getting full, consider `/compact`
- 🔴 Red (80%+) — context nearly full, `/compact` or `/clear` recommended

> **Note:** If you already have a custom `statusLine` configured, the installer
> keeps yours and prints instructions for switching to Hydra's.

---

## 🔄 Auto-Update Notifications

Hydra checks for updates once per session in the background (never blocks startup).
When a new version is available, you'll see it in the status bar:

```
🐉 │ Opus │ Ctx: 37% ████░░░░░░ │ $0.42 │ my-project │ ⚡ v1.1.0 available
```

Update with:

```bash
# From within Claude Code:
/hydra:update

# Or from your terminal:
npx hail-hydra-cc@latest --global
```

After updating, restart Claude Code to load the new files.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

After Opus 4.6 dropped, I noticed something frustrating — code execution felt slowww. Reallyyy Slow. Not because the model was worse, but because I was feeding everything through one massive model. Every file read, every grep, every test run, every docstring — all burning through Opus-tier tokens. The result? Frequent context compaction, more hallucinations, and an API bill that made me wince.

So I started experimenting. I switched to Haiku for the simple stuff — running commands, tool calls, file exploration. Sonnet for code generation, refactoring, reviews. And kept Opus only for what it's actually good at: planning, architecture, and the hard decisions. The result surprised me. Same code quality. Sometimes better — because each model was operating within a focused context window instead of one overloaded one.

Five agents. Five separate context windows. Each with a clearly defined job. They do the work, and only pass results back to the brain — Opus. The outcome:

- Longer coding sessions (less compaction, less context blowup)
- Drastically reduced API costs (Haiku 4.5 is 5× cheaper than Opus 4.6)
- Faster execution (Haiku 4.5 responds ~10× faster)
- Same or better code quality (focused context > bloated context)
- Zero manual model switching (this is the big one)

Because that was the real pain — manually switching between models for every task tier to save costs. Every. Single. Time. So I built a framework that does it for me. And honestly? It does it better than I did. That was hard to admit, but here we are.

I also didn't want it to be boring. So I gave it teeth, heads, and a battle cry. If you prefer something more buttoned-up, the [`spec-exec`](../../tree/spec-exec) branch has the same framework with zero theatrics.

*Hail Hydra. Have fun.*

## 💡 The Theory (for nerds)

Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023) accelerates LLM inference by having a small **draft model** propose tokens that a large **target model** verifies in parallel. Since verifying K tokens costs roughly the same as generating 1 token, you get 2–2.5× speedup with **zero quality loss**.

Hydra applies this at the **task level**:

```
                          ┌─────────────────────────────────┐

                          │  Result: 2-2.5× speedup         │

                                        │
                                        ▼
                          ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                          │  🐉 HYDRA (tasks)               │
                          │                                 │
                          │  Haiku/Sonnet drafts the task   │
                          │  Opus verifies (quick glance)   │
                          │  Accept or redo yourself        │
                          │  Result: 2-3× speedup           │
                          └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The math is simple: if 70% of tasks can be handled by Haiku 4.5 (10× faster, 5× cheaper) and 20% by Sonnet 4.6 (3× faster, ~1.7× cheaper), your effective speed and cost improve dramatically — even accounting for the occasional rejection.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize Hydra's behavior with an optional config file:

```bash
# Create a default config (user-level — applies to all projects)
./scripts/install.sh --config
```

Then edit `~/.claude/skills/hydra/config/hydra.config.md`:

```markdown
mode: balanced          # conservative | balanced (default) | aggressive
dispatch_log: on        # on (default) | off | verbose
auto_guard: on          # on (default) | off
```

**Project-level config** (overrides user-level):
Place at `.claude/skills/hydra/config/hydra.config.md` in your project root.

See [`config/hydra.config.md`](config/hydra.config.md) for the full reference with all options.

---

## 🧩 Extending Hydra

Add your own specialized head in three steps:

**1. Copy the template:**
```bash
cp templates/custom-agent.md agents/hydra-myspecialist.md
```

**2. Customize the agent** — edit the name, description, tools, and instructions.

**3. Deploy it:**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh --user   # or --project
```

Your new head is now discoverable by Claude Code alongside the built-in seven.
See [`templates/custom-agent.md`](templates/custom-agent.md) for the full template with
instructions on writing effective agent descriptions, output formats, and collaboration protocols.

## 📊 Expected Impact

| Metric | Without Hydra | With Hydra | Improvement |
|:-------|:-------------|:-----------|:------------|
| **Task Speed** | 1× (Opus for everything) | 2–3× faster | 🟢 Haiku 4.5 heads respond ~10× faster |
| **API Cost** | 1× (Opus 4.6 for everything) | ~0.5× | ~50% cheaper |
| **Quality** | Opus-level | Opus-level | Zero degradation |
| **User Experience** | Normal | Normal | Invisible — zero friction |
| **Overhead per turn (Turn 2+)** | Full re-exploration each turn | Session index reused | 🟢 2-4s saved per turn |
| **Scout/runner verification** | Opus reviews every output | Auto-accepted for factual data | 🟢 ~50-60% of outputs skip review |

### How the Savings Work

| Task Type | % of Work | Model Used | Input Cost vs Opus 4.6 | Output Cost vs Opus 4.6 |
|:----------|:----------|:-----------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|
| Exploration, search, tests, docs | ~50% | 🟢 Haiku 4.5 | 20% ($1 vs $5/MTok) | 20% ($5 vs $25/MTok) |
| Implementation, review, debugging | ~30% | 🔵 Sonnet 4.6 | 60% ($3 vs $5/MTok) | 60% ($15 vs $25/MTok) |
| Architecture, hard problems | ~20% | 🧠 Opus 4.6 | 100% (no change) | 100% (no change) |
| **Blended effective cost** | | | **~48% of all-Opus** | **~48% of all-Opus** |

Note: Blended input = (0.5×$1 + 0.3×$3 + 0.2×$5) / $5 = $2.40/$5 ≈ 48%.
Rounded to **~50% blended cost reduction** overall.
Savings calculated against Opus 4.6 ($5/$25 per MTok) as of February 2026.

### Measure Your Savings

The most accurate way to measure Hydra's impact — no estimation, real numbers:

1. Start a Claude Code session **without** Hydra installed
2. Complete a representative coding task
3. Note the session cost from Claude Code's cost display
4. Start a **new** session **with** Hydra installed
5. Complete a similar task
6. Compare the two costs

That's it. Real data beats theoretical calculations every time.

#### What to expect (based on February 2026 API pricing)
With a typical task distribution (50% Haiku 4.5, 30% Sonnet 4.6, 20% Opus 4.6):
- **Input tokens**: ~52% cheaper ($2.40 vs $5.00 per MTok)
- **Output tokens**: ~52% cheaper ($12.00 vs $25.00 per MTok)
- **Blended**: ~50% cost reduction
- **Speed**: 2–3× faster on delegated tasks

> Note: Savings calculated against Opus 4.6 pricing ($5/$25 per MTok) as of February 2026.
> Savings would be significantly higher compared to Opus 4.1/4.0 ($15/$75 per MTok).

---

## 🎯 Design Principles

### 🫥 Invisibility
> The user should **never** notice Hydra operating. No announcements, no permission requests, no process narration. If a head does the work, present the output as if Opus did it.

### ⚡ Speed Over Ceremony
> Don't overthink classification. Quick mental check: "Haiku? Sonnet? Me?" and go. If you spend 10 seconds classifying a 5-second task, you've defeated the purpose.

### 🔀 Parallel Heads
> Independent subtasks launch in parallel. "Fix the bug AND add tests" → two heads working simultaneously.

### ⬆️ Escalate, Never Downgrade
> If a head's output isn't good enough, Opus does it directly. No retries at the same tier. This mirrors speculative decoding's rejection sampling — when a draft token is rejected, the target model samples directly.

## 🔬 The Speculative Decoding Connection

For those who want to go deeper, here's how Hydra maps to the original speculative decoding concepts:

| Speculative Decoding Concept | Hydra Equivalent |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|
| Target model (large) | 🧠 Opus 4.6 — the orchestrator |
| Draft model (small) | 🟢 Haiku / 🔵 Sonnet heads |
| Draft K tokens | Heads draft the full task output |
| Parallel verification | Opus glances at the output |
| Modified rejection sampling | Accept → ship it. Reject → Opus redoes it. |
| Acceptance rate (~70-90%) | Target: 85%+ of delegated tasks accepted as-is |
| Guaranteed ≥1 token per loop | Every task produces a result — Opus catches failures |
| Temperature/nucleus compatibility | Works with any coding task type or domain |

## 🤔 FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Will I notice any quality difference?</strong></summary>
<br/>
No. Hydra only delegates tasks that are within each model's capability band. If there's any doubt, the task stays with Opus. And Opus always verifies — if a head's output isn't up to standard, Opus redoes it before you ever see it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this actually speculative decoding?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Not at the token level — that happens inside Anthropic's servers and we can't modify it. Hydra applies the same <em>philosophy</em> at the task level: draft with a fast model, verify with the powerful model, accept or reject. Same goals (speed + cost), same guarantees (zero quality loss), different granularity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I'm not using Opus?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Hydra is designed for the Opus-as-orchestrator pattern, but the principles apply at any tier. If you're running Sonnet as your main model, you could adjust the heads to use Haiku for everything delegatable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I customize which models the heads use?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Absolutely. Each head is a simple Markdown file with a <code>model:</code> field in the frontmatter. Change <code>model: haiku</code> to <code>model: sonnet</code> (or any supported model) and you're done.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do the heads work with subagents I already have?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Yes. Hydra heads coexist with any other subagents. Claude Code discovers all agents in the <code>.claude/agents/</code> directories. No conflicts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I uninstall?</strong></summary>
<br/>

Removes all agents, commands, hooks, and cache files. Deregisters hooks from
`~/.claude/settings.json`. Your other Claude Code configuration is preserved.

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --uninstall
# or: npx hail-hydra-cc --uninstall
```
