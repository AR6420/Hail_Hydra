description: Suppress Hydra dispatch logs for the rest of this session

# Hydra Quiet Mode

Acknowledge this command and remember for the rest of this session:

**Do NOT display the Hydra Dispatch Log footer after tasks.**

Respond with:
"🐉 Quiet mode enabled. Dispatch logs suppressed for this session. Use /hydra:verbose to re-enable."

Continue operating Hydra normally (delegation, verification, auto-guard) — just don't show the dispatch log table.
